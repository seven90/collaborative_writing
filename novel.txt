He didn't know why they were there... but they were. They didn't speak, they just stared. His nakedness was absolute and he knew they were gawking at the goosebumps that rose like braille across his fleshy flesh! It was scary but at the same time a sense of joy overwhelemed me as I stared. I dropped my cloths and when I looked back up I was face to face with two headed dragon with Khaleesi riding it. He heard a voice whispering something unclear. Suddenly the sky was filled with dragons and fire.  I jumped into my Porsche 911 Turbo S and took off like there was no tomorrow!   

wouah!!! great story so far. It's me Sandy adding a few lines. --Sandy
